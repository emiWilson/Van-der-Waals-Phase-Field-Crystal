# Van der Waals Phase Field Crystal
The files in this repository are separated into two folders:
1. Phase Diagrams: using common tangent construction via the convex hull algorithm equillibrium properties of the VdW PFC model are studied through phase diagrams. 
2. Dynamics(2D): contains all the files necessary to run dynamics in 2D for crysalization of a VdW PFC system. The C++ dynamics code requires the FFTW and MPI packages installed compatabily such that the fftw3-mpi.h package can be used.
